--- JSX CSS ---

- its basically using the style attribute in the jsx elements such as h1, div, section
- pay attention to the settings name, you cant write font-size, you have to capitalize so it should be fontSize
- inline style its more 'powerful' than css file style, so pay attention to that

    example:

        const Title = () => <h1 style={ { color: '#fff', fontSize: '0.75rem', backgroundColor: 'aquamarine' }}> TÃ­tulo </h1>
