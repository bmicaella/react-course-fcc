--- CREATING COMPONENTS ---

__FUNCTIONS

    * OP1 *
    function Greeting() { //stateless functional component => always return JSX
    //jsx
    //when creating a component, you need to capitalize the first letter, otherwise react will read it as a html component, such as div or h1
        return <h1>this is micaella and yes, this is my first component</h1>;
    }

__ARROW __FUNCTIONS

    * OP1 *
    const Greeting = () => {
    //arrow function
        return React.createElement("h2", {}, "hello worldd");
    };

    * OP2 *
    const Greeting = () => { //this would be much more complicated, so its better to just use the normal function instead of the arrow one when creating intricate html components
        return React.createElement(
        "div",
        {},
        React.createElement("h1", {}, "hello world")
        );
    };

__RENDER

    ReactDom.render(<Greeting />, document.querySelector("#root")); //looks for what you want to render (greeting) AND where it is supposed to render (div root)
