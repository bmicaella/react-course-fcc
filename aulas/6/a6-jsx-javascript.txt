--- JSX JAVASCRIPT ---

- you cant pass a statement in an object
    example:
        const Album = () => {
            const title = 'The Most Beautiful Moment In Life PT. 2'
            return (
                <article>
                <h1>{title}</h1>
                <p> {let x = 6} </p> // this wont allow the file to compile
                </article>
            )
        }
